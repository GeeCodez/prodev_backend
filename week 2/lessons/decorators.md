## What Are Decorators?

A **decorator** is a special function in Python that **wraps another function (or class)** to **add, modify, or extend its behavior** — without changing the function's original code.

Think of a decorator as a “smart wrapper” that can **add extra features** around a function.

## Why Decorators Are Important

Decorators are powerful because they help developers:

1. **Avoid repetition** – Write logic (like logging, authentication, timing, validation) once and reuse it across multiple functions.
2. **Keep code clean** – Separate “core logic” from “extra concerns.”
3. **Improve readability** – The `@decorator` line shows what additional behavior a function has.
4. **Enhance flexibility** – Easily enable, disable, or combine features.
5. **Support large-scale applications** – Ensure consistent behavior across many functions or endpoints.

## What Decorators Can Actually Do

Decorators can:

| Purpose | What They Do |
|---------|---------------|
| **Logging** | Record when and how functions are called |
| **Authentication & Authorization** | Restrict access based on user roles or permissions |
| **Validation** | Check input data before running a function |
| **Performance Tracking** | Measure execution time of functions |
| **Caching** | Store previous results to speed up repeated calls |
| **Error Handling** | Automatically handle or retry after exceptions |
| **Pre/Post Processing** | Add actions before or after the core logic |
| **Rate Limiting** | Restrict how often a function can be called |
| **API & Web Routes** | Used in frameworks to define endpoints or middleware behavior |

## Real-World Use Case Scenarios

| Domain | Example Use Case | Description |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Web Development (Flask/Django)** | `@login_required`, `@route('/home')` | Controls access and defines endpoints |
| **APIs / Microservices** | `@authenticate`, `@rate_limit` | Security and performance control |
| **Data Science / Machine Learning** | `@timer`, `@cache` | Optimize performance and reuse computations |
| **DevOps / Backend Systems** | `@retry`, `@log_call` | Automatically retry failed requests or log actions |
| **Testing / Debugging** | `@mock`, `@debug` | Simulate or monitor functions during tests |
| **Validation / Input Control** | `@validate_input`, `@sanitize_data` | Enforce rules before processing |

## When to Use Decorators

You know decorators are useful when:

- You find yourself **repeating the same “setup” or “cleanup” code** around multiple functions.
- You need to **enforce consistent rules** (e.g., authentication or logging across endpoints).
- You want to **add cross-cutting behavior** like caching, timing, or validation, without modifying the function code itself.

## Examples

### 1. Function that returns a value

```python
def uppercase(func):
    def wrapper():
        result = func()
        return result.upper()
    return wrapper

@uppercase
def message():
    return "hello world"

print(message())  # Output: HELLO WORLD

```
### 2. Real world authentication
```
logged_in = False

def authenticate(func):
    def wrapper():
        if not logged_in:
            print("Access denied")
            return
        func()
    return wrapper

@authenticate
def view_dashboard():
    print("Dashboard loaded")
```
